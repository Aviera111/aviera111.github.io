 A simple small town girl who dreams big.<br>I am very unexpected and always inquisitive.<br>
 Every day to me is another day to make another person SMILE. </p>

<p id="first-p">I enjoy life at its best travelling and finding new adventures that add 
value to my life. I am a hard worker and I do not like to discourage or disappoint
 anyone who believes in me. I am a computer freak people say but that doesn't mean 
 that I sit in one place and code.I have a life outside the computer world but my 
 laptop is like a part of my body my best buddy. My passion is helping the unfortunate
 and providing them the little happiness in anyway that I could. By profession I am 
 a techno-preneur and I am a postgraduate studying computing as well. I am a dreamer
 with a plan and I am working hard on succeeding it.</p>

<div class="col-6"> 
   <p id="second-p">I am a techno-preneur which means I learn a new technology and I make sure 
 to polish that new technology and uproot an entrepreneur out of this. As i 
 told earlier I love helping the unfortunate I am a volunteer and I love seeing
 another person succeed and to put a smile on their faces. So what I basically 
 do is that I visit villages and children's homes and I teach kids and give them
 the knowledge I have. My ultimate goal is for these kids to one day put their own 
 businesses using the knowledge the technology that I taught and to guide 
 them throughout the path that they choose. I dream big and I work hard to
 make someone else's wish come true. For now I am a freelancer I do web-designing
 as a part-time and I am a project manager at a well established Start-up company.</p>
