    <div class="bio-main-content"> <p id="life">I enjoy life at its best travelling and finding new adventures that add value to my life. I am a hard worker and I do not like to discourage or disappoint anyone who believes in me. I am a computer freak people say but that doesn't mean that I sit in one place and code.I have a life outside the computer world but my laptop is like a part of my body my best buddy. My passion is helping the unfortunate and providing them the little happiness in anyway that I could. By proffesion I am a technopreneur and I am a postgraduate studying computing as well. I am a dreamer with a plan and i am working hard on succeeding it.<div class="avi"><img src="./img/l.jpg" alt="l" width="300" height="300"></div></p>
</div></div></div><!--end main-->
	<div class="bio-submain"><p id="life"> I am a <span="bold">technopreneur</span> which means I learn a new technology and I make sure to polish that new technology and uproot an entrepreneur out of this. As i told earlier I love helping the unfortunate I am a volunteer and I love seeing another person suceed and to put a smile on their faces. So what I basically do is that I visit villages and childrens homes and I teach kids and give them the knowledge. My ultimate goal is for these kids to one day put their own business using the knowledge on the technology that I tought and to guide then through out the path that they choose. I dream big and i work hard to ake some one else's wish come true. For now i am a freelancer I do web-designing as a part-time and I am a project manager at a well established Startup comapany.</p>
